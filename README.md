# recipe-db

This is an automated backup of my personal recipe website's db, at <http://xanthir.com/recipes/>. A lot of the recipes originate from cookbooks or other websites, and I don't claim copyright on these; for those that are original, I release the recipes to the public domain.

If you can find some use for this data yourself, great! Feel free to do so. However, I will not be accepting any issues or PRs on this project.
